// The base struct that has all the functions necessary to operate on a coroutine. It is designed to be used in one of
// two ways:
// - As the argument to a func passed to one of the Start functions. It can then be used as a proxy for the
//   coroutine function. e.g.: `msg := e.Recv()`
// - Embedded directly into another struct, so that the struct can call the coroutine functions as if they were its
//   own. e.g.: `type A struct { coroutine.Embeddable }` The struct that embeds the coroutine struct can then
//   implement the Start method on the Starter interface and an instance of it can be passed directly to one of the
//   Start functions. Embeddable MUST be embedded as a non-pointer, and the struct embedding it MUST be used as a
//   pointer.
